### Poker

You and the computer are opponents in this game of draw poker. At the start of the game, each player is given $200. The game ends when either player runs out of money, although if you go broke the computer will offer to buy back your wristwatch or diamond tie tack.

The computer opens the betting before the draw; you open the betting after the draw. If you don’t have a hand that’s worth anything and you want to fold, bet 0. Prior to the draw, to check the draw, you may bet .5. Of course, if the computer has made a bet, you must match it in order to draw or, if you have a good hand, you may raise the bet at any time.
