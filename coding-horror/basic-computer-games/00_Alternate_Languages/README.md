#### Alternate Languages

This folder contains implementations of each program in alternate languages which are _not_ one of the agreed upon 10 languages, intended to meet these three criteria:

1. Popular (by TIOBE index)
2. Memory safe
3. Generally considered a 'scripting' language

We welcome additional ports in whatever language you prefer, but these additional ports are for educational purposes only, and do not count towards the donation total at the end of the project.
