##### Translator Notes:
I tried to preserve as much of the original layout and flow of the code
as possible.  I added a procedure for the printing of the die-face; and
another to read an integer from the player, as I was unhappy with the runtime
error message spat out when a non-number is given to readln(<integer>).

I was torn between using the correct singular term "die" instead of "dice".
In the end I used a (poor?) combination of both.
