Each subfolder represents a port of this program to a language which is _not_ one of the agreed upon 10 languages, which are intended to meet these three criteria:

1. Popular (by TIOBE index)
2. Memory safe
3. Generally considered a 'scripting' language

We welcome additional ports, but these additional ports are for educational purposes only.
