The object of Bug is to finish your bug before I finish
mine. Each number stands for a part of the bug body.
I will roll the die for you, tell you what I rolled for you
what the number stands for, and if you can get the part.
If you can get the part I will give it to you.
The same will happen on my turn.
If there is a change in either bug I will give you the
option of seeing the pictures of the bugs.
The numbers stand for parts as follows:
Number        Part          Number of part needed
 1            Body           1
 2            Neck           1
 3            Head           1
 4            Feelers        2
 5            Tail           1
 6            Legs           6
