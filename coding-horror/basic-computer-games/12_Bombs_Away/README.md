### Bombs Away

In this program, you fly a World War II bomber for one of the four protagonists of the war. You then pick your target or the type of plane you are flying. Depending on your flying experience and the quality of enemy defenders, you then may accomplish your mission, get shot down, or make it back through enemy fire. In any case, you get a chance to fly again.

David Ahl modified the original program which was created by David Sherman while a student at Curtis Jr. High School, Sudbury, Massachusetts.
