Conversion to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

This version preserves the underlying algorithms and functionality of
the original while using more modern programming constructs
(functions, classes, symbols) and providing much more detailed
comments.  It also fixes some (but not all) of the bugs.
