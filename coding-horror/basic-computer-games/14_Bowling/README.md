### Bowling

This is a simulated bowling game for up to four players. You play 10 frames. To roll the ball, you simply type “ROLL.” After each roll, the computer will show you a diagram of the remaining pins (“0” means the pin is down, “+” means it is still standing), and it will give you a roll analysis:
- GUTTER
- STRIKE
- SPARE
- ERROR (on second ball if pins still standing)

Bowling was written by Paul Peraino while a student at Woodrow Wilson High School, San Francisco, California.
