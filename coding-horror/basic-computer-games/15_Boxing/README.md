### Boxing

This program simulates a three-round Olympic boxing match. The computer coaches one of the boxers and determines his punches and defences, while you do the same for your boxer. At the start of the match, you may specify your manâ€™s best punch and his vulnerability.

There are approximately seven major punches per round, although this may be varied. The best out if three rounds wins.

Jesse Lynch of St. Paul, Minnesota created this program.
