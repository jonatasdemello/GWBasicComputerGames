### Banner

This program creates a large banner on a terminal of any message you input. The letters may be any dimension of you wish although the letter height plus distance from left-hand side should not exceed 6 inches. Experiment with the height and width until you get a pleasing effect on whatever terminal you are using.

This program was written by Leonard Rosendust of Brooklyn, New York.
