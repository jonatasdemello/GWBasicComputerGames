Chomp is for 1 or more players (humans only).

Here's how a board looks (this one is 5 by 7):

       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 1     P * * * * * *
 2     * * * * * * *
 3     * * * * * * *
 4     * * * * * * *
 5     * * * * * * *


The board is a big cookie - R rows high and C columns
wide. You input R and C at the start. In the upper left
corner of the cookie is a poison square (P). The one who
chomps the poison square loses. To take a chomp, type the
row and column of one of the squares on the cookie.
All of the squares below and to the right of that square
(including that square, too) disappear -- Chomp!!
No fair chomping on squares that have already been chomped,
or that are outside the original dimensions of the cookie.
