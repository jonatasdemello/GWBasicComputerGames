David Ahl's Basic Computer Games


This archive contains a copy of the book on Word 2003 format.  The "(abridged)" 
version is a copy of the book without the program code, since electronic copies 
of the programs are included here.  (It's better for printing, if you don't need 
a hard copy of the programs.)

READ_ME.NOW is the readme file that was on the Web site where I found this book 
(http://www.atariarchives.org/bca/).

M.BAS is the menu file for the games.  The other .BAS files are the games 
themselves.

Enjoy the games!
